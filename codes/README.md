# Codes

## Question - A

### Harmonics

- a1.m -> Creating two versions of the melody, one with the odd harmonics (3, 5, and 7) and another with the even harmonics.

### Virtual Pitch

- a2.m -> Removing the fundamentals to create the same melody with virtual pitch and also removing the first harmonics to form another melody

## Question - B

### Rhythm & Meter

- b1_2.m -> Estimating the tempo of the excerpts in the sample music of the samples folder using miraudio command

- b1_3.m -> Estimating the time course of development tempo and comparing it to the ranges of variation of tempo and analysing.

### Repetition in Music

- b2.m -> Extracting the chromagram vectors of the excerpt (x.wav) frame by frame, using the mirchromagram operator and plotting the Computed Similarity Matrix [x = RollNumber % 7 => x = 2020101069 % 7 = 0.wav]

- b2_samples.m -> Doing the same for sample music from sample folder using chromagram, mfcc and spectrum audio features and plotting the Computed Similarity Matrix for each sample.
